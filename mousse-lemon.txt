Ingredients:
 - 4 Greek yogurts.
 - one 8-ounce condensed milk.
 - 4 lemons.
Directions:
1. Cut in half and squeeze the lemons.
2. Once this is done, pour the yogurts into a bowl.
3. Pour the condensed milk into the bowl where you have the yogurts to continue with the lemon mousse.
4. Add the lemon juice to the previously strained bowl to avoid adding any seeds by mistake.
5. Beat until lemon mousse with yogurt and condensed milk is emulsified.
6. Put the preparation in the refrigerator so that it cools and distribute it in containers.
